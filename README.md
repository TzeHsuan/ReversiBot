# Python Telegram Bot Playing Reversi

[Here](https://hackmd.io/@truckski/BJ_l615N2) is the instructions by the professor and teaching assistants.

[Here](https://youtu.be/WrXAK5qLIC4) is the demo video.

## How to Run The Code
I run my code using PyCharm CE.
Firstly, a telegram account is needed, and it is required to add @BotFather. [Here](https://www.toptal.com/python/telegram-bot-tutorial-python) is a tutorial for adding the botfather and creating your own bot. Note that the token code generated after the bot has been created is important, and it needs to be added to mytoken.py
After running the main.py, return to the telegram bot. By sending /start, the bot will reply with instructions of what to type to start the game.
